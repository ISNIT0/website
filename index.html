        <p>Originally running on Google Docs and HandbookPls, the CoronavirusTechHandbook quickly reached Google Doc's
            soft limits (100 concurrent editors and 10k viewers/month). I, the project's CTO, was tasked with finding a
            way around these limits. It was clear that Operational Transform (Google Docs, Ether Pad, etc.)
            was never going to scale to the level we needed it to, so opted to develop a full editing experience based
            on CRDT. The JoeDocs team and product were built and launched in under a month using some money from the
            CoronavirusTechHandbook.

        <p>Before the UK lock-downs, I helped create the CoronavirusTechHandbook. We raised $100k from NESTA and
            GrantForTheWeb to develop the base technology and content for the handbook. The handbook had great impact,
            reaching hundreds of thousands of people around the world, and connecting domain experts from different
            fields who shared ideas and innovated in cross-domain projects.</p>

            made HandbookPls, which allowed us to add domain names, analytics, and tabs to the Google Documents. This
            allowed the website to become viral, reaching tens of thousands of political technologists around the UK.

        <p>After my previous startup - Della - I decided to work on social-good projects. I decided to focus my efforts

            a community of technologists passionate about fixing news.
            Under this brand, so far, I have run two hackathons and 6 meetups.</p>
